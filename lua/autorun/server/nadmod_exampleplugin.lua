/* Notes on writing ChatCommands:
	NADMOD.FindPlayer(string) is a convenience function that returns the ent of the player whose name contains 'string'.
	NADMOD.GuessTarget(ply,args) is a convenience function that attempts to find a target based on args[1], defaults to the ply if none is found, and also returns the next arg
	local tar,hp = NADMOD.GuessTarget(ply,args) // For '!cmd Neb 20' this'll return 'Entity[neb] & 20', while '!cmd 20' returns 'Entity[you] & 20'

	RETURN A # AND A "MESSAGE", because everyone likes chat response to their commands. The # corresponds with what kind of message you want.
	return 1, "This is an --error-- message just to the player."
	return 2, "This is a normal message just to the player."
	return 3, "This is a normal message to all gmodders."
